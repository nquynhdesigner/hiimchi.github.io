      <h6 class="w3-center">Writing for Chi! </h6> <br><br><br><br>
      <p class="w3-center ">5h30 am 15/10. Almost 2 days to meet you. <br> At this moment, when I'm writing these lines, I do not know where I am taking the strong to overcome the greatest pain in life to have you.<br> Maybe it's because of motherly love?<br>
It is said that the sore mounds are similar to a feeling of fracture of 20 ribs at once. That's not going to be wrong. <br>I really feel like I'm going to live again. The pains are more and more and longer while the amniotic fluid stops between the legs. <br>Both my body drenched. The bowl. Many times between the obstacles, I think I can not withstand anymore.<br> But imagine how the face of you will be, remembering each stroke, every one of them from the little baby to this moment, I feel I can overcome them all. <br>After many hours of wrestling, the doctor moved me to the operating room. <br>Lying in that place, alone, cold, in the ears of a doctor's questions, I think when I will met you? The answers are interrupted and I don't remember what I said.<br> I know only in the midst of the charm, between the splenic sounds of the cutlery, of the conversation, of a dozen other things that echoes in my head, I tried to say let me hug you when you was born. <br> 5h30 am, crying voice echoes the operating room. The doctors asked me if I am awake, I want to hug you. I said yes. When the doctor put you in my arms and kept you fixed with a cloth, I cried. <br>You cried, too. For the first time in my life, I saw tears of happiness mixed with sweet taste. <br> Here's the mouth, and the eyes are trying to ttalk to me. My baby is so adorable. Very lovely. <br>The moment I touched your little hands and you holding my fingers, I thought that everything I had exchanged was worthy. <br>The pains, the bumps, the fears, everything little by little before you. At the bottom of the curtain, the doctors continued to sew each incision. <br>But I don't care because what I see now is a tiny baby in my mother's womb that needs to be protected and protected. <br>I am not very strong, but with you, I am willing to bear all the pain on my part. I love you.<br>I love you.<br></p>
